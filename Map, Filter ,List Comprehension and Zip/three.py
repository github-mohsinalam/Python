#Challenge: Below, we have provided a list of lists that contain numbers.
#Using list comprehension, create a new list threes that contains all the numbers from the original list that are divisible by 3.
#This can be accomplished in one line of code.



nums = [[4, 3, 12, 10], [8, 7, 6], [5, 18, 15, 7, 11], [9, 4], [24, 20, 17], [3, 5]]

threes = [i for subList in nums for i in subList if i%3 == 0]
